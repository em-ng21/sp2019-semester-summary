# URAP CoolClimate Summary

[This site](https://em-ng21.github.io/sp2019-semester-summary/) contains a summary of work I was able to contribute to as a member of [EcoDataLab's Transportation team](https://coolclimate.org/ecodatalab/teamtrans.html), under the direction of the CoolClimate Network. The original summary report was written at the end of the Spring 2019 semester.

In July 2020, I removed outdated links and added a section to include a Tableau tutorial video I recorded.
